Turn Procedure:

Once you have selected a unit to Order, it follows this process:

1) Any 'On Activation' Abilities take place. 

2) The units available actions pop up. These will usually be (at least) Move, Shoot, Melee, Change Formation. If a unit can usually take one of those actions but can't, it will be greyed out. Make sure that hovering over the button tells you why it's not available.

2) Each unit has two actions by default. They can do them in any order.
